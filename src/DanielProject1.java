/**
 *
 * 21 - Card Game
 * The card game will allow you to utilize JavaFX  and Object Oriented Programming.
 *
 * Rules of the game:
 * Draw cards from the dealer's shuffled deck.
 * 21 is an automatic win for the dealer always wins on a draw
 * If the dealer gets 17 or more he must stand (cannot draw any more cards)
 *
 * Card values:
 * Jack, Queen King = 10
 * Ace can be 1 or 11
 * Cards 1 to 10 are the card value
 * Hold logic, when the player feels they have enough points to win (remember under 21).
 * The hold will allow the control to switch to the dealer
 * There should be two buttons - Draw & Hold
 * When switching to the dealer, the dealer should draw until a win (greater than the players score) or the dealers draw is greater than 21 (when the player has won).
 * Messaging should be presented when the player has won or lost.
